# Desktop Calculator (Java, JavaFX)

## Overview
A JavaFX desktop calculator application capable of evaluating algebraic expressions, including variables. Built with a responsive GUI and robust error handling for invalid expressions, division by zero, and undefined variables. The project leverages multithreading to ensure a smooth user experience.

> Note: The `AstNode`, `Lexer`, and `TokenStream` classes were provided by my professor and form the core parsing logic.

## Features
- Evaluate arithmetic expressions with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.
- Support for variables and assignment.
- Error detection for invalid input, division by zero, and undefined variables.
- Responsive GUI with input field, result display, and error messages.
- Buttons for digits, operations, and calculator functions (clear, backspace, delete variable).
