# Desktop Calculator

**Languages:** Java, JavaFX

## Overview
A JavaFX-based desktop calculator capable of evaluating algebraic expressions, including variables. Integrates computational logic provided by the professor (lexer, token, and AST classes in C++) into a functional, user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Intuitive **JavaFX GUI** for entering expressions and viewing results.
- Evaluates algebraic expressions using provided **C++ lexer, token, and AST logic**.
- Supports variable assignment and deletion (`x = 5`, `all` to clear variables).
- Provides **real-time feedback** for divide-by-zero, undefined variables, and syntax errors.
- Handles user interactions via keyboard or button clicks, including backspace, clear entry, and arithmetic operations.

## Project Highlights
- Integrated pre-existing computational classes into a JavaFX application.
- Developed **robust input validation** and user feedback mechanisms.
- Created a responsive interface that maintains focus and caret for efficient user input.
